Changelog for Spaceman Spiff's Chording Keyboard Experiment

This pre-release is for people to test the overall functions, before
making the truely public release of version 1.00.

Other than that, there are a few things that will soon be 
implemented:
1) On/Off-function.
2) LED handling (showing state)
3) Extra modifier keys.

the release of version 1.00.
