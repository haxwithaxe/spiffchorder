Changelog for Spaceman Spiff's Chording Keyboard Experiment

While release of version 1.00 of the SpiffChorder has not yet been
planned, the current version 0.99 can be considered stable. On my
part (Spiff's), the development happens in bursts, so I expect it
to be put on the back burner most of the time, and then occationally
pulled out and moved forward.

If you have any ideas for improvement, please go ahead and drop me
a note (see http://symlink.dk/contact/ for details). Also, if you want
to get involved in the development of the SpiffChorder, feel free to
drop me a note.

These are a few things that are on the TODO-list, but no final decision
has been taken concerning when these will be implemented, and in what
order:
1) On/Off-function.
2) LED handling (showing state)
3) Extra modifier keys.

It has not yet been decided if these will be implemented before or after
the release of version 1.00.
