This file describes the changes made to USBaspLoader in order to use
it with the SpiffChorder Chording Keyboard.

More information about the SpiccChorder can be found at
http://symlink.dk/projects/spiffchorder/ 
and
http://chorder.cs.vassar.edu/spiffchorder/forside

The changes described below have been done in order to make the
bootloader compatible with the SpiffChorder hardware design, and
to trigger the boot loader by holding the 3 thumb-buttons while
plugging in the device. Also, because we are not using a jumper
to activate the boot loader, but momentary buttons, the condition
that checks if the bootloader should be terminated has been removed.

I (Spiff) had problems with BSOD when using avrdude and this bootloader.
The problems were resolved when I updated WinAVR and win-libusb. If you
experiencing problems, you might want to make sure you have a recent 
version. I tested this on Windows XP SP3 with WinAVR-20080512 and 
libusb-win32 0.1.12.1. Get them here:

    static inline void  bootLoaderInit(void)
    {
        PORTB = 0x3F;  /* Enable pull-ups */
        PORTD |= 0xC0; /* Enable pull-ups */
